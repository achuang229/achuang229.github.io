		<h1>Chih-Yuan Chuang's Portfolio</h1>
		<h3>"Do your work for six years; but in the seventh, go into solitude or among strangers, so that the memory of your friends 
	     	     does not hinder you from being what you have become" - Leo Szilard</h3><br />


		<p>
  		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a versatile mechanical engineer with enthusiasm for both scientific research and industrial product development. My experience from
		a number of internships have given me considerable knowledge to work with MEMS processing equipment and medical device. I also apply myself with
		zeal to research in biomaterials and investigating new biologically based treatment for arterial disease, i.e. cerebral aneurysm.
  		</p>
		<br />
		<p>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After graduation, I would see myself developing a unifying force between nature and artificiality. I envision that one day I can apply the combined knowledge that I learn from robotics and pathological research to design self-maintenance awareness for in vivo bio-robots to extend their service life, 
		or equip them with decision-making to assist in identification of unnoticeable symptoms common to infectious diseases. The relevant applications will include, but are not limited to, early-stage medical diagnosis and prevention of epidemic.
